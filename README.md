# QA1-Devops-SDAT

Course Name: Software Design, Architecture, Testing and DevOps  

Instructions:

This QAP covers aspects from both DevOps and Software Design, Architecture and Testing.

Java Junit Testing and GitHub Actions (running unit tests)

Start with a new maven based Java project as we did during our class lecture.

I would like you to implement unit tests for the SuggestionEngine class provided (https://github.com/jamie-keyin/Keyin-JUnit-Demo/blob/master/src/main/java/com/keyin/SuggestionEngine.java). You must provide at least 3 different test cases that cover different user cases. You can determine what use cases should be covered by a test.

Once you have your tests implemented locally you have to share your project to GitHub and setup the GitHub action on the master/main branch to require unit tests to be run before allowing a PR to be merged.

The submission must be a URL (link) to a GitHub repo for your maven project. Please post a document to the Teams assignment page with this link in it. Note: be sure I can access your repo, Iâ€™ll need to do that to provide feedback and mark the project.

Good Luck and have fun!
